## About Me

Hi! My Name is Piyush, and my journey into cybersecurity began unexpectedly. Despite initially aiming for a career in medicine, I found my true passion in technology. Intrigued by the world of cybersecurity, I delved into this dynamic field.
Exploring various aspects of cybersecurity, I initially focused on web penetration testing. As I delved deeper, I discovered the defensive side, particularly the role of a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst. This led me to pursue the Google Cybersecurity Certification.
Today, I am proficient in offensive and defensive security practices, specializing in web penetration testing and SOC analyst roles. My journey reflects my unwavering curiosity and determination to excel in the dynamic field of cybersecurity.
